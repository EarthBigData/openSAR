Notebooks to analyze and visualize data in the Global Coherence and Backscatter Data Set

To run the notebooks locally (i.e., not a JupyterHub environment), install the [seppoloc](https://github.com/EarthBigData/openSAR/tree/master/yaml) kernel

	conda env create -f seppoloc.yaml



Register the kernel in your jupterhub environment (see instllation instructions for openSAR environments) and make sure to select the seppoloc environment in the notebooks (Defaults to *seppo* kernels)
